# HoVer-Net: Simultaneous Segmentation and Classification of Nuclei in Multi-Tissue Histology Images

This code is based on the implementation of [Quoc Dang Vu](https://github.com/vqdang) and [Simon Graham](https://github.com/simongraham) available at [this link](https://github.com/vqdang/hover_net). This code uses new loss functions with various encoders implemented. <br />



## Dataset

The colour of the nuclear boundary denotes the type of nucleus. <br />
Blue: epithelial<br />
Red: inflammatory <br />
Green: spindle-shaped <br />
Cyan: miscellaneous
